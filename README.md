# Decision Tree Classification

This repository demonstrates how to prepare a dataset for a Decision Tree Classification model by performing one-hot encoding on categorical features and evaluating the model using a confusion matrix.

## Key Concepts

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Converts categorical variables into a binary (0 or 1) representation, making the data suitable for machine learning models.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Provides detailed insights into the performance of a classification model by showing the counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Derived from the confusion matrix, these metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity, offering a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
